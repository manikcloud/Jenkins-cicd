# Install Maven on Ubuntu and Create a Simple Maven Project

### Previous Branch Details

In the previous branch, we created a simple Java HelloWorld program using the Java command line. You can review the previous branch for more information.

### Clone the Repository and Switch to the `3.1.1-maven-style` Branch

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/manikcloud/Jenkins-cicd.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
cd Jenkins-cicd/
```
3. Switch to the `3.1.1-maven-style` branch by running the following command:

```
git switch 3.1.1-maven-style
```

Now that you have switched to the `3.1.1-maven-style` branch.

# Maven Installation on Ubuntu

1. Install Maven on your Ubuntu machine by running the following command:

2. Verify the Maven installation by running:

3. Create a simple Maven project using the following command:

4. Install the `tree` package to view the project structure:

5. Navigate to the `my-app` directory:

6. Display the project structure using the `tree` command:

7. Build the Maven project by running:

8. Execute the Java program from the Maven project:


```
sudo apt install maven
mvn --version

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
sudo apt install tree -y

cd my-app/

tree
mvn install

tree
java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App
```

# Maven Archetype: Generate Command

The following command is used to create a new Maven project from a specific archetype template:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
```

## Explanation of Parameters

- `groupId`: The group ID of the project, typically following the reverse domain name pattern (e.g., `com.mycompany.app`).
- `artifactId`: The unique identifier for the project, which will also be used as the project folder name (e.g., `my-app`).
- `archetypeArtifactId`: The identifier of the archetype template used to generate the project structure (e.g., `maven-archetype-quickstart`).
- `archetypeVersion`: The version of the archetype template to be used (e.g., `1.4`).
- `interactiveMode`: A boolean flag indicating whether Maven should run in interactive mode (e.g., `false`).



# Maven Goals

Maven goals are specific tasks executed as part of the Maven build process. Some common Maven goals are `clean`, `install`, `package`, and `test`.

## Common Maven Goals

1. **clean**: The `clean` goal is used to remove all files generated by the previous build, ensuring a fresh build state. To run this goal, use the command:

   ```
   mvn clean
   ```

2. **install**: The `install` goal compiles, tests, and packages the project, and then installs the generated artifacts into the local repository. This allows other projects to use this project as a dependency. To run this goal, use the command:

   ```
   mvn install
   ```

3. **package**: The `package` goal compiles and tests the project, then packages the compiled code into the specified format (e.g., JAR, WAR, etc.). To run this goal, use the command:

   ```
   mvn package
   ```

4. **test**: The `test` goal compiles and tests the project, ensuring that the project's test suite passes. To run this goal, use the command:

   ```
   mvn test
   ```

These goals are part of Maven's build lifecycle and can be executed individually or combined. For example, to run both `clean` and `install` goals, use the command:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Goals of Maven

1. **Project Object Model (POM)**: Maven uses an XML file, the POM, to describe the project, its dependencies, and the build process.
2. **Dependency Management**: Maven automatically manages project dependencies and transitive dependencies.
3. **Standardized Build Process**: Maven standardizes the build process, making it easier for developers to understand the build process across different projects.
4. **Build Lifecycle**: Maven has a predefined build lifecycle, which consists of a series of build phases that the project goes through to be built and deployed.
5. **Build Plugins**: Maven provides plugins to support various build tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, packaging, and deploying applications.
6. **Project Reporting**: Maven can generate project documentation and reports, including code coverage, test results, and dependency information.



### Next Steps

In the next step, we will configure Maven in Jenkins and create a Maven job in Jenkins to build and run the project.
